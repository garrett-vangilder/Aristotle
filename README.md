# Aristotle

### Problem
During my former teaching career I often forgot to update the attendance for each class. It was also difficult to keep hardcopies of the attendance documentation. 

### Purpose

Aristotle is an easy to use attendance tracker created for teachers to keep up to date records and metrics for each student.
